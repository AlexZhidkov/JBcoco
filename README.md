# JBcoco 


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone

Clone the repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/AlexZhidkov/JBcoco.git
cd JBcoco
```

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply run **in the project folder**:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

## Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
gulp serve
```



## Testing

There are two kinds of tests in the application: Unit tests and End to End tests.

### Running Unit Tests

The app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in
[Jasmine][jasmine], which we run with the [Karma Test Runner][karma]. We provide a Karma
configuration file to run them.

* the configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`
* the unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and are named as `*.spec.ts`.

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
gulp test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will sit and
watch the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them change.
This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then
you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.

You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit.  This is useful if you want to
check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected.  The project contains a
predefined script to do this:

```
gulp test-single-run
```


### End to end testing

The app comes with end-to-end tests, again written in [Jasmine][jasmine]. These tests
are run with the [Protractor][protractor] End-to-End test runner.  It uses native events and has
special features for Angular applications.

* the configuration is found at `protractor-conf.js`
* the end-to-end tests are found in `e2e-tests/scenarios.js`

You can run the end-to-end tests using the supplied npm script:

```
gulp protractor
```

This script will execute the end-to-end tests against the application being hosted on the
development server.


## Updating 

You can update the tool dependencies by running:

```
npm update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `package.json` file.

You can update the Angular dependencies by running:

```
bower update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `bower.json` file.


## Continuous Integration

### Travis CI

[Travis CI][travis] is a continuous integration service, which can monitor GitHub for new commits
to your repository and execute scripts such as building the app or running tests. The 
project contains a Travis configuration file, `.travis.yml`, which will cause Travis to run your
tests when you push to GitHub.
